Note: This solution is terrible. I will redo it in rust soon!

Intuition

I had a feeling I could do this with pure math using mod, but decided to take the easy way out, switch from rust to python, and write the most tragic program imaginable.

Approach

I ignored my intuition to use a simple mod function, and instead opted for a for loop. I converted the integer to a string so I could iterate the "number", and used a while loop with case handling to output the reversed number. I should be banned from coding for this.
Complexity

    Time complexity:
    O(n2) due to string concatenation

    Space complexity:
    O(n)
