Intuition

My intuition was to create a nested while loop, which is what I wound up doing in the end.

Approach

I have not touched nested while loops and the associated logic in a while. This one was fun as it reminded me of the Harvard CX50 I did years ago. I quickly ran into issues with the "in-place" aspect of this problem, and had many bugs to work through. I know there is a more optimal solution, so I will revisit this one in the future. For now, this code passed the test once I worked out the logic issues with the nested while loops.
Complexity

    Time complexity:
    O(n2)

    Space complexity:
    0(n)
